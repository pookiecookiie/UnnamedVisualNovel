Turned out, I was banging my head against a walll. I wasn't planning well, and when it came time to make content for the game I FINALLY, realized my mistake.
I am going to make a separate repo for Visual novel or Dialog Helper stuff that I may or may not use in future projects.


This is going to stay the way it is, until i finish writting all basic building blocks and specific mechanics for the type of feel I initialy wanted.
